h1. Sentinel

Transparent (unobtrusive) Observers for your Rubies.

h2. Why?

Developed for an specific need we had at "Busk":http://www.busk.com, Sentinel is a very small library that provides a way to add what we call "Transparent Observers" to your Ruby code. This means that you do not need to modify the observed methods (following the most common implementation of Observers), just use a mixin and declare your observers.

h2. How?

First, install the gem:

<pre>
$ [sudo] gem install sentinel
</pre>

Then, add it as a dependency in your code using your favorite way (a simple require or mechanisms the bundler gem). 

To use it, first you'll need an observer class that responds to a method called _notify_ (which can be a class or instance method). All the observed method's arguments will be passed to this method, hence the _args_ splat.

<pre>
class MyObserver
  def self.notify(*args)
    puts "Do your thing!"
  end
end
</pre>

Then, simple include the _Sentinel_ module in the class and declare the observer. Sentinel can observe both class and instance methods:

<pre>
class MyClass
  include Sentinel

  def instance_method
    puts "Hi from the instance method!"
  end

  def self.class_method
    puts "Hi from the class method!"
  end

  observe :instance_method, :notify => MyObserver
  observe :class_method, :notify => MyObserver, :class_method => true #to observe a class method
end
</pre>

If we wanted to use instances of the Observer instead of the class itself, the declarations would be:

<pre>
  observe :instance_method, :notify => MyObserver.new
  observe :class_method, :notify => MyObserver.new, :class_method => true #to observe a class method
</pre>
  
In summary, any object the responds to _notify_ will be accepted.

h2. Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
